# shmebulock

A silly Discord bot inspired by Gravity Falls  
When someone says "Shmebulock" in a message, Shmebulock responds with his name, an emoji of himself, or both.  
Free to use and modify for personal/educational purposes.
  
## Requirements: 
 - Python 3.8 or higher
 - Pycord https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/
 - An application with a bot account on the Discord development portal https://discord.com/developers/applications 
 
## How to use:
Once you've installed all the dependencies and changed all the placeholders in the code, just save and launch this .py script. See the comments in the code for more details.

## Bot commissions:
I offer custom Pycord bot commissions starting at $30 and bot cloud hosting at $6/mo on my Ko-fi page! https://ko-fi.com/dolusdulcis/commissions
