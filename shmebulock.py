# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#   Shmebulock!
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# A silly Discord bot inspired by Gravity Falls
# Free to use and modify for personal/educational purposes.

# Requirements: 
# - Python 3.8 or higher
# - Pycord https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/
# - An application with a bot account on the Discord development portal https://discord.com/developers/applications 

# OAuth2 scopes needed: bot

bot = discord.Bot(intents=discord.Intents.all()) # Requires all of the privileged gateway intents in the Bot section of 
# the Discord developer portal (this should not be an issue as long as the bot is in fewer than 100 servers)

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"We have logged in as {bot.user}") # Gives console feedback when the bot logs on
    await bot.change_presence(status=discord.Status.online, activity=discord.Game(name="Shmebulock!")) # Fun custom status

# When someone says "Shmebulock" in a message, Shmebulock responds with his name, an emoji of himself, or both.
# If you don't want to use an emoji, remove the <:EMOJI:ID> placeholder from the responses list.

bot.run("TOKEN")
# Replace "TOKEN" with your bot's token (found in your developer portal) with quotes
# so that the bot will come online when the program runs.

# Once you've installed all the dependencies and changed all the placeholders in the code, just save and launch this .py script.
# Resetting the token in the Discord developer portal is a good way to shut down the bot quickly so you can make changes in the code.
